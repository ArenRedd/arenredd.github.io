**19th May Log – Digital Lockdown Initiated**

Today, I dove into the rabbit hole of password security. Been using the same old Gmail for years, but let’s be real—Gmail’s not exactly Fort Knox. Sure, it’s clean and popular, but Google’s got eyes everywhere. They scan your emails, mine your data, and tie everything into their giant ecosystem. It’s smooth for the average user—but not for someone who values digital privacy.

So I started scouting for a more locked-down email provider. Came across a few names—ProtonMail, Tutanota, Skiff—but Tutanota caught my eye. Turns out, it’s now just called **Tuta**. Clean. Private. Encrypted. No ads. No logs. Signed up and set it as my new digital basecamp.

Next layer—**2FA**. If you’re not using it, you’re walking into the web wide open. Physical 2FA keys are top-tier, but for now, I’m rolling with OTP-based authentication. Better than nothing—and way better than single-password logins.

Wrapped up the session with some reading on data breaches and leaks. It’s insane how much personal info is floating around in the dark corners of the net. If you’re not locking down your digital doors, someone else will walk through them.

**Stay sharp. Stay rooted.**
