# **How I Installed Kali NetHunter on My Android Without Rooting (And Lived to Tell the Tale)**

So, you want to turn your innocent Android phone into a pocket-sized hacking machine without voiding your warranty? Good newsâ€”Kali NetHunter can now runÂ **rootless**! No kingly root permissions needed, just Termux, some patience, and a willingness to ignore a few ominous Android warnings.

Hereâ€™s how I did it (and how you can too, without summoning the wrath of Googleâ€™s security overlords).

---

## **Disclaimer: Donâ€™t Be a Menace**

Before we beginâ€”this is forÂ **education and awareness only**. No illegal shenanigans. If you use this to hack your neighborâ€™s Wi-Fi to change their router name to "FBI Surveillance Van," thatâ€™s on you.

---

## **What Youâ€™ll Need**

- **An Android phone (Android 12+ works, but itâ€™s feisty)**
    - Android 12+ has a habit of murdering background processes like a overzealous task manager. Weâ€™ll tame it later.
- **Termux (the magic portal to Linux on Android)**
    - Get it fromÂ [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/)Â orÂ [GitHub](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases).Â **Avoid the Play Store versionâ€”itâ€™s ancient.**

---

## **Step 1: Summon Termux from the Digital Abyss**

1. **Install Termux**Â (the APK you just downloaded).
2. **Open it**Â and type:CopyDownload
    
    ```bash
    pkg update -y
    ```
    
    (This is like giving Termux its morning coffee.)
    
3. **Grant storage access**Â (so it doesnâ€™t live in digital solitary confinement):CopyDownload
    
    ```bash
    termux-setup-storage
    ```
    

---

## **Step 2: Download the NetHunter Install Script**

Time to fetch the goods:

```bash
pkg install wget -y
wget -O install-nethunter-termux https://offs.ec/2MceZWr
chmod +x install-nethunter-termux
```

*(Translation: "Hey Termux, download this suspicious-looking script and make it executable. Trust me.")*

---

## **Step 3: Run the Script (And Pray)**

Execute the installer:

```bash
./install-nethunter-termux
```

- **Choose your NetHunter flavor**Â (I went with the full version because why not?).
- **Wait.**Â This takes a while. Go make tea. Or coffee. Or contemplate life.

When asked:

- **"Delete downloaded rootfs?"**Â â†’Â **N**Â (Unless you enjoy re-downloading 2GB for fun.)

---

## **Step 4: Stop Android from Killing Your Fun**

Android 12+ has a nasty habit of terminating background processes (like NetHunter). Hereâ€™s how to disable its murderous tendencies:

1. **Enable Developer Options**Â (tap "Build Number" in Settings 7 times like a secret code).
2. **Find "Disable child process restrictions"**Â and toggle itÂ **ON**.
    
    *(Now Android wonâ€™t assassinate NetHunter mid-session.)*
    

---

## **Step 5: Launch NetHunter Like a Hacker**

- **CLI Mode:**CopyDownload
    
    ```bash
    nh
    ```
    
    *(Boom. Youâ€™re in Kali Linux.)*
    
- **GUI Mode (KeX VNC):**CopyDownload
    
    ```bash
    nh kex passwd  # Set a password
    nh kex &       # Start the GUI
    ```
    
    *(Now you have a full Kali desktop on your phone. Wild.)*
    

---

## **Step 6: Install the NetHunter Store (For Extra Tools)**

1. **Download the NetHunter Store APK**Â fromÂ [their site](https://store.nethunter.com/).
2. **Ignore Androidâ€™s frantic warnings**Â ("This app is old! It might summon demons!").
3. **Install KeX Client**Â from the store to connect to your VNC session.

---

## **Final Boss: Connect to KeX**

- Open the KeX app.
- Create a new connection:
    - **Port:**Â **`5901`**
    - **Password:**Â (The one you set earlier)
- **Connect.**

**Congratulations!**Â You now have Kali NetHunter runningÂ **without root**, looking slick on your Android.

---

## **What Now?**

- Explore Kali tools (**`metasploit`**,Â **`aircrack-ng`**, etc.).
- **Donâ€™t do anything dumb.**

---

### **Final Warning**

Android may occasionally side-eye you for running a full Linux distro in the background. If NetHunter gets killed, just restart it and shake your fist at the sky.

Happy (ethical) hacking! ðŸš€ðŸ”’
