# Oops, I Stole Your Session: The Cookie Monster's Guide to Bypassing 2FA Like a Boss

**TL;DR**: You’re not as safe as you think. Strong passwords? ✅ 2FA? ✅ But none of that matters when your cookies get swiped faster than free Wi-Fi at DEFCON.

## 🍪 Welcome to the Dark Side (We Have Cookies)

Hey hackers and cyber-gremlins 👾,

Ever thought your 16-character, upper-lower-symbol-number password paired with that shiny YubiKey made you invincible? Well, guess again, friend. Because today, we’re diving headfirst into a demo so juicy it makes the OWASP Top 10 blush.

Let’s break it down.

## 🍴 Cookie Theft 101: Three Ways to Jack a Session

This ain’t theoretical. It’s hands-on, nitty-gritty, real-world exploitation. Here’s how it went down:

### **1. Inspect Element Hack – The Beginner's Cookie Swipe**

**Tools Needed**: A browser. That’s it.

- Logged into GitHub as a ZTW admin.
- Right-click → Inspect → Application → Cookies.
- Copy session cookies from the victim.
- Paste into the attacker’s browser.
- Refresh… *BOOM!* You’re now the admin.

> “But wait, what about 2FA?”
> 
> 
> It’s already been *bypassed*. You copied the session. Credentials? MFA? Irrelevant.
> 

🎯 *Lesson*: Don’t underestimate physical access. One second in the wrong hands = your whole account pwned.

### **2. Chrome Extension of Doom**

**Tool**: `Storage Ace` (No, it’s not your friend.)

The victim installs a shady Chrome extension (hi Honey 🍯), and suddenly:

- Cookies are exported to a JSON file.
- Attacker loads them.
- Admin access achieved again.

Extensions are like stray cats. Just because they look cute and helpful doesn’t mean they won’t claw your eyes out later.

💡 *Pro tip*: Never install extensions unless you know exactly what they’re doing behind the curtain. And even then… maybe don’t.

### **3. Malware Madness – The Final Cookie Form**

**Tool**: `hack-browser-data.exe`

**System**: Windows, Linux, macOS — yep, everyone’s invited to the breach party.

The malware:

- Steals browser cookies from Firefox (Chrome encrypts now — but we’re not out of options).
- Rips saved passwords from *all major browsers*.
- Outputs everything into a beautiful .txt file like a twisted cyber-gift basket.

Even Linux users, those smug terminal-dwelling wizards, are vulnerable. This malware doesn’t discriminate.

🎯 *Pro Hacker Move*: Use a Rubber Ducky to auto-run scripts and exfiltrate data in a blink. We’re talking one-second access. That’s faster than your VPN can connect.

## 🎁 The GitHub Goldmine

dropped **ALL THE TOOLS** and scripts in one juicy repo:

- ✅ Cookie theft demos
- ✅ Ducky scripts
- ✅ Malware config
- ✅ Step-by-step how-to for each method

Want to become a session-slaying cookie ninja? [His GitHub](https://github.com/ZTW-Labs) is where your journey begins. Just remember — don’t be a script kiddie. **Use these for educational purposes only.** ZTW has labs and safe environments. *Use them or lose your freedom.*

## 🛡️ So… Should I Panic?

Not exactly. But you *should* rethink your threat model. Because if an attacker gets access to your cookies:

- Password = Useless
- 2FA = Bypassed
- Your accounts = Toast

🔥 *It’s not just about protecting passwords anymore — it's about guarding your sessions like they're nuclear launch codes.*

## 📣 Final Words From the Shadows

This wasn’t a proof of concept. This was a real, working, multi-layer demo that turns your browser into a backdoor with just a few clicks.

So next time you're sipping coffee thinking your FIDO key has your back, just remember…

**Someone might already be logged in as you.**

Until next time,

Stay paranoid. Stay patched.
