# 🚀 From Noob to 3rd Prize: My First Hackathon XP at ARIFA HACKATHON 2025

Okay fam, let’s be real. Walking into my first hackathon felt like logging into an unknown Wi-Fi with **“Are you sure you want to continue? Y/N”** vibes. Nervous? Hell yeah. Excited? Double that.

But ARIFA HACKATHON 2025 – கடற்களம் wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a full-on arena where geeks, coders, engineers, med folks, and even management wizards came together to throw ideas like packets flying across a chaotic network.

And guess what? I didn’t just survive… I snagged the **3rd prize 🏆**. Not bad for a first-timer, huh? 😎

## 💡 What I Learned (aka patch notes for my brain)

- **Team Leadership:** Turns out leading a squad is harder than managing a Kali Linux VM with 2GB RAM. But I figured it out.
- **Presentation Skills:** Explaining tech to non-tech people = like running `nc -lvnp 4444` and hoping someone actually connects.
- **Problem Solving:** Hackathons are basically CTFs IRL. You either solve or you crash and burn. I solved.

## 🕶️ The Hacker Loot – StartupTN Smart Card

Now here’s the cool part. Along with the prize, I scored the **StartupTN Smart Card**. Think of it as a cheat code for startups in Tamil Nadu:

- Discounts on legal, compliance, finance, and IT/software stuff
- Marketing boosts without burning your crypto stash
- Basically, less stress, more building

If you’re a builder, this card is like running `sudo` in the startup world. Total game-changer.

## 🌟 Why This Hackathon Hit Different

Most hackathons are like speed dating for code. But this one? It was about creativity, guts, and vibes. The organizers (**AIIC + StartupTN**) didn’t just throw an event, they opened a portal for young hackers and innovators to level up.

And for me? This was my **origin story**. From nervous first-timer to standing on stage with a prize, the XP boost was real. Next time, I’m aiming for root access — aka **1st place**.

⚡ Question for you Cyber fellows: What was YOUR first hackathon like? Did you crash the system or walk away with root privileges?
