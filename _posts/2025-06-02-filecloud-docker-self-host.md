# 🐧 From Chaos to Cloud: Spinning Up FileCloud Like a Cyber Sorcerer

> "When in doubt, docker ps it out." – Ancient Hacker Proverb
> 

It was a sunny Sunday—too peaceful, really. I needed something to break the monotony. That’s when I decided to summon the mighty beast of self-hosted file storage: **FileCloud**. But not just any setup—I wanted it **Dockerized**, clean-ish on every reboot, with storage rooted in my sacred `/mnt/shared/cloud-server`.

## ⚙️ Enter the Void: The First Invocation

I ran the FileCloud Docker container like a true sysadmin of the arcane:

```bash
sudo docker run --privileged -d \
  -p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
  -v fcdata:/opt/fileclouddata \
  -v dbdata:/var/lib/mongodb \
  -v solrdata:/opt/solrfcdata/var/solr \
  -v htmldata:/var/www/html \
  --name filecloud \
  filecloud/fileclouddocker:latest \
  /lib/systemd/systemd
```

Boom. The container spawned like a summoned daemon, bound to ports 80 and 443. FileCloud came alive... almost.

## 🤯 The Path of Pain: Storage Path Not Set

As the dashboard loaded, it greeted me with a cryptic complaint:

> ❌ Storage Path Not Set. Invalid Path.
> 

I double-checked everything. My volumes were mounted, my paths were blessed with `chmod 777`, and yet FileCloud whispered: "Try again, mortal."

Turns out FileCloud wanted **a real path**, not a Docker volume abstraction. The container needed to see `/mnt/shared/cloud-server` like a physical realm, not a volume spell.

### 🧙‍♂️ The Hackening: Binding Shared Storage

So I banished the old container to the nether realms:

```bash
sudo docker stop filecloud
sudo docker rm filecloud
```

Then I bound `/mnt/shared/cloud-server` directly to `/opt/fileclouddata`, where FileCloud likes to nap:

```bash
sudo docker run --privileged -d \
  -p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
  -v /mnt/shared/cloud-server:/opt/fileclouddata \
  -v dbdata:/var/lib/mongodb \
  -v solrdata:/opt/solrfcdata/var/solr \
  -v htmldata:/var/www/html \
  --name filecloud \
  filecloud/fileclouddocker:latest \
  /lib/systemd/systemd
```

I also gave ownership to the web server deities:

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /mnt/shared/cloud-server
```

Like magic, FileCloud accepted the offering. Files placed inside `/mnt/shared/cloud-server` started appearing in the UI like ghosts in the machine.

## 🔁 Summon and Banish: My Ritual Script

I needed a non-clean (persistent) way to start and stop the container. So I crafted the sacred incantations:

```bash
# Start the beast
sudo docker start filecloud

# Send it to slumber
sudo docker stop filecloud
```

No data loss. Just a clean nap and wake-up for the daemon. The volumes stay. My files remain untouched. Bliss.

## 🎉 Conclusion: I Tamed the Cloud

FileCloud now lives happily inside Docker, chilling with my shared mount point. If you're trying the same and getting hit with *"Storage path invalid"*, don’t argue with the daemon. Just feed it the path it can see.

**Pro tip**: Volumes are cool, but mounted folders are real enough to please the cloud gods.

Happy hacking, and may your `/mnt` be ever mounted.

*"Storage was a mess. Containers were chaos. But I came, I saw, I `docker run`'d it."*
