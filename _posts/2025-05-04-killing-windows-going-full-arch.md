# **Killing Windows â€“ Why Iâ€™m Going Full Arch Linux**

**Date: May 4, 2025**

Enough.

Iâ€™ve had it with Windowsâ€”its bloated nonsense, forced updates, and the way it treats users like dumb terminals in its data-harvesting mainframe. Today, Iâ€™m wiping it from my drive and replacing it withÂ **Arch Linux**. No more dual-boot safety net. No more "but what if I need Windows for something?"

I donâ€™t. And neither do you.

### **ðŸ”¥ Why Arch Linux is the Only Real Choice**

### **Total Control â€“ No Training Wheels**

Arch doesnâ€™t coddle you. It drops you into a terminal and says,Â *"Figure it out."*Â No bloat, no pre-installed crapâ€”justÂ **your**Â system, builtÂ **your**Â way.

### **Windows is a RAM-Hogging Joke**

Open Task Manager on Windows and watch it choke on its own background services. Arch? Runs like a scalpelâ€”fast, precise,Â **efficient**. Toss inÂ **i3**Â orÂ **bspwm**, and suddenly your old hardware feels like a beast.

### **Rolling Release â€“ No More Update Hell**

Windows forces updates that break things, then forces reboots at the worst possible time. Arch? Updates whenÂ **you**Â want. Latest software, no corporate babysitting.

### **Pacman + AUR â€“ Where the Real Power Is**

- **Pacman**Â â€“ Installs, removes, updatesâ€”**fast**.
- **AUR**Â â€“ The wild west of software. If it exists, itâ€™s here. Proprietary apps, obscure tools, bleeding-edge scriptsâ€”Windows users are stuck waiting. We take what we need.

### **Learn or Get Out**

Arch installation is aÂ **trial by fire**. Youâ€™ll learn partitions, bootloaders, kernel flagsâ€”real sysadmin stuff. Windows hides all that behind a pretty GUI because it thinks youâ€™re too stupid to handle it.

### **Privacy Isnâ€™t an "Enterprise Feature"**

Windows 11 is spyware with a desktop environment. Arch? No telemetry, no ads, no "user experience tracking." Just an OS thatÂ **does what you tell it to.**

### **Kali and Arch â€“ The Perfect Pair**

Both Linux. Both speak the same language. Swap tools, scripts, configsâ€”no weird compatibility layers, no WSL hacks. JustÂ **real**Â hacking.

### **Execution: Delete Windows, Install Freedom**

- **Grabbed**Â the Arch ISO.
- **Burnt**Â it to USB withÂ **`dd`**Â (because Etcher is for beginners).
- **Nuked**Â the Windows partition with GParted. No regrets.
- **Time to install**â€”no GUI, no hand-holding. Just me, the terminal, and a system thatÂ **actually respects its user.**

This isnâ€™t just a switch. Itâ€™s aÂ **declaration of independence**.

Next? Full disk encryption. Kernel hardening. A setup so lean it makes Windows look like a bloated corpse.

The future is Arch.
