# From Script Kiddie to Cyber Jedi: My Call with a Hacker That Roasted Me

So yesterday, I pulled a bold move.

I called up a cybersecurity expert — not just some random YouTuber, but my college sir’s friend. I wanted to ask one simple doubt:

👉 *“Bro, should I do the CEH (EC-Council) course now?”*

What I got instead?

A reality check so heavy it almost `rm -rf /`’d my confidence.

### The Roast Session 🍿

First, this guy tells me:

> “Cybersecurity is a long path, my friend. You need to know every single thing in networking and IT before you even think about CEH.”
> 

Then he drops the bomb:

> “How would you hack my phone? If you connect to my network, I can get inside yours.”
> 

Bruh. I froze like a misconfigured firewall.

After a few grilling questions, he looks at me (through the phone, lol) and says the words that still echo in my ears:

💀 **“You’re a script kiddie.”**

(If you don’t know, that’s basically hacker slang for a noob who just runs tools without understanding them. Ouch.)

### The Networking Slap 🖧

He asked me:

“How do you architect a company’s security?”

Me, trying to sound pro:

“Uh… start with a firewall?”

Him: *“WRONG. Firewall is not the first thing. What comes before it?”*

Me: *404 knowledge not found.*

He went on explaining layers, stages, blah blah — basically confirming I’m not strong in networking yet.

### The Homework Assignment 📚

Before ending the call, he dropped his “to-learn” bomb list:

- Master **networking** (OSI layers, protocols, etc.)
- Basics of **Java, HTML, CSS, Python, Bash**
- Deep dive into **Linux** (I told him I already broke Arch & Kali multiple times, so I got some creds there).

He said CEH is not for beginners. Maybe in my 4th year of college.

Right now, I gotta grind.

### My Hacker’s Dilemma 🕶️

So here I am, 6 months deep into Linux, battled with OS installs, solved random customization bugs, but… still stuck. Networking feels like my final boss fight.

And honestly? Getting called a script kiddie hurt. But maybe that’s the hacker way — you gotta get roasted, broken, humbled, and then rise.

Like they say:

⚡ *Every script kiddie has the potential to become a cyber Jedi… if they don’t rage-quit halfway.*

So yeah, back to my textbooks and terminals.

Next time, when someone asks me about firewalls, I won’t just say “uh, put one at the gate.”
