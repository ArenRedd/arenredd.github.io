# 🚀 From Dead Boot to BIOS Resurrection: Aren’s Journey with a ThinkPad

So picture this: You’ve got your trusty **Lenovo ThinkPad** sitting on the desk. Rugged, reliable, meant to survive nuclear blasts… but today, it refuses to boot. BIOS stuck in the Stone Age (2016 version). USB not detected. OS? Completely nuked.

Most people would cry.

But hackers? We see this as a *side quest*. 🕶️

## 🛠️ The Problem

- BIOS version: **R06ET33W (1.07)** — last updated back when dinosaurs roamed.
- Boot menu? Nope. USB drives invisible.
- OS? Crashed harder than Windows ME.
- Me: Sitting there with Kali Linux and vibes.

This wasn’t a laptop anymore… it was a **brick with RGB-free LEDs**.

## ⚡ The Hack

Step 1: **Find the right BIOS**

After digging through Lenovo’s site (because Google results love trolling with the wrong models), I finally snagged the update package for the ThinkPad T460s (20FMS00B12).

Step 2: **Bootable BIOS update USB**

No Windows? No problem. I prepped the update USB in Linux and dropped it into the ThinkPad like a hacker offering sacrifices to the silicon gods.

Step 3: **The Ritual**

Boot → BIOS menu → “Update System Program” → Cross fingers → Flash complete.

Boom 💥 — BIOS now reads **2022-02-21**. Fresh.

## 🕹️ The Real Fight: OS Install

Now came the spicy part — **bootable USB OS install**.

BalenaEtcher was cool, but no GPT/MBR toggle.

Solution? **Ventoy**. The Swiss-Army knife of bootloaders.

I deployed Ventoy from Kali, slapped a Windows ISO on it, and… finally, the ThinkPad showed a Windows boot page. Victory? Not yet.

Because Windows pulled the classic:

> “This disk is not supported.”
> 

Yeah, thanks Microsoft.

## 🧙 The Fix

Partition magic time. Using disk tools, I cleared, formatted, and aligned the NVMe drive properly. Windows finally said:

> “Proceed.”
> 

Installation rolled like butter.

## 🔑 The Lesson

This entire rabbit hole taught me three things:

1. **Never trust an old BIOS** — it’ll betray you at the worst possible moment.
2. **Ventoy > Rufus** when you’re stuck in Linux land.
3. Hackers don’t quit. If the machine fights back, we just fight harder.

## 🖤 The Aren’s Spirit

Most would’ve tossed the ThinkPad in frustration.

But for us? This was the perfect CTF challenge.

And when the final boot screen loaded…

I sat back and whispered:

**“I am a man of my words.”** 😎
